# NBA Career Length Predictor

## Overview  
This project aims to predict the career length of NBA players based on historical data using various statistical models. It is a work-in-progress and serves as both a learning experiment and a practical application of data science techniques.

## Dataset  
The dataset used for this project contains information about NBA players, including their playing years and other attributes that may affect their career length. The data is stored in the `data/nba-playerlist.csv` file. 

**Columns:**  
- `FROM_YEAR`: The year the player started their NBA career.  
- `TO_YEAR`: The year the player ended their NBA career.  
- `OTHERLEAGUE_EXPERIENCE_CH`: Experience in other leagues.  
- Other columns include player attributes, but these need to be refined for the prediction model.
